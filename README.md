## Overview

This repository contains a custom-built UAV simulation framework that models the dynamics and control of a small fixedâ€‘wing aircraft.  
It integrates:

- **Nonlinear flight dynamics** derived from standard aircraft equations of motion.
- **Trim calculation routines** to establish equilibrium states for specific flight conditions.
- **Linearization methods** that generate transferâ€‘function and stateâ€‘space representations for control design and analysis.
- **3D rendering and visualization** of the aircraft geometry, body axes, and simulation outputs.

The project serves as a foundation for experimenting with guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) algorithms, while providing an educational platform for testing new ideas in flight dynamics.

## Current Status

**Active Development:**  
The simulator has been rebuilt after an earlier data loss, and a working baseline is already running.  
At present you can:

- Load an aircraft configuration and compute trim for given airspeed and flightâ€‘path parameters.
- Generate preliminary stateâ€‘space and transferâ€‘function models around the trim condition.
- Run the dynamics in a custom C++ simulation loop with live 3D visualization.

Soon you should be able to provide a path to the UAV and watch it generate waypoints and use an autopilot to navigate itself to the destination autonomously :D

## Recent Changelog:

<div style="max-height: 100px; overflow-y: scroll; border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px; margin: 10px 0;">

*26th July 2025*
- **Documentation:** Doxygen workflow set up. Documentation is now automatically generated and published online at [https://msk2000.github.io/UAV-Simulator](https://msk2000.github.io/UAV-Simulator).

*25th July 2025*
- **Trim:** Implemented automated trim point calculation and corresponding control settings and sim initialisation.
- **Memory Leaks:** Fixed some memory leak bugs.
- **Waypoint Navigation:** Work on waypoint navigation started. A sample path (in red) and waypoints(yellow) can be seen in the most recent update video.
- **ImGUI/ImPlot:** Live plotting of state variables integrated into simulation (see recent video). A control panel for elevator,rudder, aileron and throttle input has been added to the gui.

*6th July 2025*

- **Terrain Texture Mapping:** Implemented texture mapping on the STL terrain using UV coordinates and a texture image. Normalized and tiled the UVs for consistent texture scaling.
- **Texture Wrap Mode:** Set texture wrap mode to `REPEAT` to allow seamless tiling across the terrain surface.
- **Coordinate Adjustment:** Corrected UV mapping to use the X and Y axes (`pos[0]`, `pos[1]`) instead of X and Z, since Z is the up-axis in this simulator.
- **Shadow Rendering:** Attempted basic hard shadow support for the aircraft model using Easy3D's `Shadow` class. **Pending Implementation**.
- **HUD Implementation:** Integrated a Heads-Up Display (HUD) in the viewer using Easy3D's `TextRenderer`. The HUD overlays real-time flight data from the aircraft onto the screen during simulation.
- **Viewer Improvements:** Introduced a new `TestViewer` class derived from Easy3Dâ€™s `Viewer`. This class handles aircraft HUD rendering, user input for aircraft control, and shadow rendering(incomplete).

*28th October 2024*
- **Runga-Kutta 4:** Changed the simplistic solver to RK4 based integrator for much better estimation of state parameters.

*20th October 2024*
- **Modularization:** Refactored the **forces and moments** function from a monolithic structure to a more modular design for improved clarity and maintainability.
- **Dynamics Function:** Transitioned the **dynamics** function to a modular structure, facilitating easier updates and modifications.
- **Animation Cleanup:** Cleaned up the **animation** function by introducing an **update** function that manages all necessary updates to the simulation before rendering.
- **Coordinate Frame:** Added a **body frame coordinate system** that is always visible and coincident with the aircraft, providing a consistent reference for the simulation.

*16th October 2024*
- **Visualisation Method:** Changed the simple vertex/face based rendering to surface mesh based one allowing for import of any 3d model into the simulator.
- **Changes to Aircraft Class:** Removed multiple depricated functionds and added new ones to help with the new render system.

### Usage

Each of these parameters is used to model the dynamics of the aircraft in simulation, ensuring that the response to control inputs and environmental factors is accurate. For more details, refer to the implementation in `simulation.h`. Additional details about how to obtain these parameters for a given UAV will be provided in the future.
